# Chocolate Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing various types of chocolates to make informed decisions about their sales potential, pricing, and estimated revenue.

## Objectives
1. **Initial Data Analysis**:  
   In the first step, we will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. This will help us understand the structure of the data and highlight key patterns or anomalies.

2. **Sales Potential and Pricing**:  
   We will examine different types of chocolates and identify those suitable for sale. Based on the analysis, we will estimate the prices for these chocolates.

3. **Top Chocolate Manufacturers**:  
   In this phase, we will identify the top chocolate manufacturers and update the chocolate prices based on their brand value. Additionally, we will calculate the projected revenue from selling these chocolates.
